    <h1>About MYSURU DASARA Festival</h1>
    <p>Dasara festival is also called Navaratri. The reason why we worship Goddess Durga is related to this story below:<br>

Long ago, there was a demon king named <u>Mahishasura</u>. He was mad with power and wanted to become immortal and rule the whole three lokas. Thus, he did an intense penance to Lord Brahma and took a boon. He wished that ‘no man or animal’ would kill him. Lord Brahma granted the boon with a twist saying he would die in the hands of a woman.</p><hr>
<p>Durga is another incarnation of Maa Parvati. She is the threshold of feminine power. She waged a war against Mahishasura. The war went on for nine days and Mahishasura kept changing his forms from one animal to another thus confusing Durga.<b>On the tenth day, when he was in the Buffalo face, Goddess Durga killed him with a single bow with her Trident</b>. That day was Vijaya Dasami. </p><hr>
  <p>The nine days that she fought against Mahishasura represent the fighting of good and evil. Thus, these nine days are considered immensely sacred in the Hindu religion. Sadhu, saints, and religious scholars worship Maa Shakti on these nine days in her various avatars.<em> On the tenth day – the Dasara festival, is the culmination of these worships and prayers.</em></p>
